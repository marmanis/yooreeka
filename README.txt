Quick start for running book examples on Windows platform
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

______________________________________________________________________________		
1. Verify your environment

        1.1  Make sure that you've placed all distribution files under a directory
             on your filesystem, say, "C:\code\yooreeka" on a Windows OS or /code/yooreeka
             on a Linux OS. You can call that directory whatever you want.
	     
	1.2  Create a new environment variable YOOREEKA_HOME with the above directory as its value
             
        1.3  Set the property yooreeka.home in the yooreeka.properties file, so that
             it points to the installation directory mentioned above. Make sure the rest 
             of the properties are consistently pointing to the appropriate locations. 
        
        1.4  Start windows command line interpreter (cmd.exe) and confirm that you 
             can run java and ant from the command line on your system. 
        
             Within a Windows command prompt, execute the following:
        
                 java -version
                 ant -version
        
                If you get an error see step 2. Otherwise skip to step 3.
        
______________________________________________________________________________		
2. Configure your Java and Ant environment variables

	You can skip this step, if you already have JDK and Ant configured on your 
	system to run from command line. Assuming that java jdk is in C:\jdk1.7.0_10 
	and Ant is in C:\apache-ant-1.7.0 use the following commands:

		SET JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.7.0_10
		SET ANT_HOME=C:\apache-ant-1.7.0
		SET PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ANT_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
		
		SET JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF8
	
	If your JDK or Ant are installed elsewhere, please, change the above values 
	accordingly.

    The JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS ensures that files containing UTF-8 characters 
    will not cause the build to fail. Details about this environment variable
    can be found here: 
    
    http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#tooloptions
    
    At this point you should be able to run java and ant from command line 
    without errors. If you've only configured environment for your current 
    command line interpreter make sure that you perform steps 3 and 4 in 
    the same instance of interpreter.

______________________________________________________________________________		
3. Reset your CLASSPATH environment variable

	Type the following command in your command prompt:
	
		SET CLASSPATH=

	This command empties your classpath, which is required for the rest of the 
	process to work. In other words, we assume a clean slate for the CLASSPATH 
	environment variable.
 
______________________________________________________________________________		
4. Run ant build file for the project: 

	Within the same command prompt execute the following two commands:

		cd /D C:\code\yooreeka\build
		ant

	Ant will execute the default target from the C:\iWeb2\build\build.xml 
	build file. It will build all source code and will prepare the 
	'C:\code\yooreeka\deploy' directory. 

______________________________________________________________________________		
5. Start the BeanShell

	Within the same command prompt execute:

		C:\code\yooreeka\deploy\bin\bsc.bat

______________________________________________________________________________		
	
You are ready to run book examples!!!	

Note: Within the BeanShell you will have command history. So, if you typed 
something and you would like to repeat it the command with different argument
values or type something else similar to the previous command, you can use the 
UP / DOWN arrows to move up and down the history of the BeanShell commands,
respectively.

Enjoy!
