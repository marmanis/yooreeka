        <b>
      
    
      
        Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon is adamant that Chelsea target Robinho will not be leaving the Bernabeu.
      
    
      
        </b>
      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Chelsea made a £19.7m bid for Robinho, 24, on Thursday and he is believed to be keen to join fellow Brazilian Luiz Felipe Scolari at Stamford Bridge.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
But Calderon told BBC Radio 5 Live: "Definitely, he is going to stay with us. The coach (Bernd Schuster) has said he wants him in our team.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"We don't see any possibility of Robinho leaving Real Madrid."

      
    
    
  

  
    
      
      <div class="bo">
    
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
BBC Sport revealed in July that the Blues were monitoring Robinho, although media reports that they had made a £48m bid were wide of the mark.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Chelsea confirmed on Thursday that they have made a formal offer for the former Santos star.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"We know that Chelsea are interested in signing him," Calderon added.

"I don't mind that other clubs try to sign our players - it's normal, we have very good players. Anyone would like to have one of them for sale.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"But Robinho wants to be with us. He is one of the best players we have in our team and we need him for next season."

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon said on 3 August that, although talks with Real had stalled, he remains hopeful that a deal for Robinho would go through.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Kenyon believes Madrid's eagerness to secure a replacement is the only factor preventing him from moving to Stamford Bridge.

"A key issue over buying Robinho has always been that Real are looking for a replacement," he told his club's website.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"It is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions."

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Scolari, who took over as Chelsea boss in July, is currently working on bringing in new faces ahead of his first Premier League campaign.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Robinho has previously stated: "It would be a dream for me to work with Luiz Felipe Scolari, who is one of the best coaches in the world.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"I have always spoken highly of him and he has always spoken very highly of me, since well before he was at Chelsea.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"In 2003, when I was unknown in Europe, he called me to play in a charity match. It was brief but it was enough for me to see his style and character."

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
And Robinho's agent, Wagner Ribeiro, was reported as saying in Spain: "Madrid have failed to value him as he deserves and I do not like the fact that they tried to include him in the Ronaldo deal. Money is not the problem for us now.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"What matters for Robinho is to leave the club and play for Scolari at Chelsea."

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Ribeiro also told Spanish newspaper Marca from Bogota, where Real are currently on
tour: "Robinho is very angry with the way the Madrid bosses are dealing with him.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"He calls me every day to know whether anyone has spoken to me about his future, and I always have to tell him that no one has called.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"I have been trying to speak with someone from the club for three days. Robinho does not understand what is going on."
