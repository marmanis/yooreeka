        World number two Jelena Jankovic fought back from a set down to book her place in the last eight of the US Open at the expense of Dane Caroline Wozniacki.
      
    
      
        </b>
      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
A sluggish Jankovic allowed Wozniacki to break early and seal the first set 6-3 but the Serb found her rhythm and came through 3-6 6-2 6-1.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
The second seed will meet Austria's Sybille Bammer in the quarter-finals.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Olympic champion Elena Dementieva needed just 61 minutes to see off Li Na of China 6-4 6-1.

The Russian, seeded fifth, will now meet 
      
    
      
        <b>
      
    
      
        Patty Schnyder

        .

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Just as she had at Wimbledon earlier this year, Jankovic dropped the opening set against 18-year-old Wozniacki.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
But once the second seed broke for a 4-2 lead in the second set, the Danish teenager's resistance crumbled.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"I had to really play a lot more aggressive because it's quite windy and she was a lot more solid than I was in the first set," said Jankovic.

"I took a bit more control in the second and cruised through in the third so I am really pleased."

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Jankovic is one of four players who can overtake compatriot Ana Ivanovic as world number one at the end of the tournament.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Russians Dementieva and Dinara Safina along with Serena Williams are the others.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
But Jankovic said her main aim was to capture her first Grand Slam title.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"It (the number one ranking) is a goal, but I want to win a Grand Slam," she said.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"Of course, by winning a Grand Slam I will regain the number one ranking, and that is something I want really bad. I will try my best to achieve that."

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Dementieva can become world number one if she reaches the final and the 26-year-old believes she is returning to the form which saw her win the Olympic title in Beijing.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"It took me a week before I started to feel the ball and play a little better than in the beginning of the tournament," she said.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"After playing four matches here, I feel pretty focused on this event."

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        <b>
      
    
      
        Bammer
      
    
      
        </b>
      
    
      
        , the 29th seed, reached the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for the first time when she came through a marathon match against Marion Bartoli.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
The Austrian prevailed 7-6 (7-3) 0-6 6-4 against the 11th seed after three hours and three minutes - matching the longest women's match at the US Open on record.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Bartoli struggled in the hot conditions and twice sought treatment from the trainer.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"It's a miracle I could manage three sets," said Bartoli, who said she was suffering from a stomach bug and low blood pressure.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        <b>
      
    
      
        Schnyder
      
    
      
        </b>
      
    
      
        , playing in her 12th US Open, reached the quarter-finals for the first time in 10 years with a 4-6 6-3 6-3 win over Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik - who knocked out world number four Svetlana Kuznetsova in the previous round.
