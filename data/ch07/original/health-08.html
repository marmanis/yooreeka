      A chemical in vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage can boost DNA repair in cells and may stop them becoming cancerous, a study says.

      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Another chemical in soy also performs the same role, the Georgetown University team said.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Although a link has already been found between eating these foods and a reduced cancer risk, this research shows how that might happen.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The research is published in the British Journal of Cancer.

Vegetables such as broccoli were found to contain a compound called I3C.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
And a chemical called genistein found in soy beans. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The repair proteins, regulated by genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2, are important for preventing damaged genetic information being passed on to the next generation of cells. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
If people have a faulty BRCA gene they are at a higher risk of developing some forms of cancer, including breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Low amounts of the BRCA proteins are seen in cancer cells, so the scientists propose higher levels might prevent cancer developing. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Researchers suggest the ability of I3C and genistein to boost the amount of BRCA proteins could explain their protective effects.

      'Clear process'
    	  
  	
    
      </b>
    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Professor Eliot Rosen, who led the research, said: "Studies that monitor people's diets and their health have found links between certain types of food and cancer risk. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"However, before we can say a food protects against cancer, we have to understand how it does this at a molecular level."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
He added: "It is now clear that the function of crucial cancer genes can be influenced by compounds in the things we eat. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"Our findings suggest a clear molecular process that would explain the connection between diet and cancer prevention."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Professor John Toy, medical director of Cancer Research UK, which owns the British Journal of Cancer, said: "Diet's role in cancer prevention is complex. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"This research explores an interesting hypothesis as to how certain components of diet can affect cancer risk. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"The evidence is building that these chemical compounds act on some of the genes inside cells that help prevent cancer developing."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
But he added: "We still don't know if this is exactly how these chemicals might act in every day life."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
However he said it had been established that eating a balanced diet, which was high in fibre plus plenty of fruit and vegetables, lowered the risks of developing many forms of cancer.
