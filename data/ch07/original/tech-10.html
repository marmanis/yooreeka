The 18-year-old high school student is accused of stabbing the cab driver to death by trying to copy a scene from the game. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The biggest video game publisher in the south-east Asian country, New Era Interactive Media, has told retailers to stop selling GTA IV.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
It is due to be replaced by another video game title.

Thai newspapers say the teenager, whose name has been withheld, was arrested while trying to steer a cab backwards out of a Bangkok street with the driver still in the back seat.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Police claim the 18-year-old confessed to stealing the taxi and said he killed the 54-year-old driver after he fought back. The teenager could face the death penalty if he is found guilty.

Bangkok police Captain Veerarit Pipatanasak said: "He wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game.

Thailand's Culture Ministry has recently been pushing for tougher regulation of games like Grand Theft Auto.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
It wants stricter age ratings and restrictions on the hours that people can play games in arcades.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Ladda Thangsupachai, director of the ministry's Cultural Surveillance Centre, said: "This time-bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse. Today it is a cab driver, but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner."
