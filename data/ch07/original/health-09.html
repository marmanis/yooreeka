      Scientists say they have taken a big step towards blocking a chemical vital to the growth of many cancers.

      They have unpicked the structure of telomerase, an enzyme which, when active, helps keep cells in an "immortal" state.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      The chemical is at work in more than nine out of ten types of tumour.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      Researchers from Philadelphia's Wistar Institute, writing in the journal Nature, say their efforts could lead to drugs which switch it off.

      All cells in the body have a natural clock - the telomeres - which shorten every time the cell divides.

After a fixed number of divisions in most cells, the telomeres are reduced to a certain length, and the cell cannot continue dividing.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      This change is responsible for changes within the ageing body, as cell division slows down.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      Some cells, such as stem cells within the embryo, use the chemical telomerase to maintain telomere length.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      Many tumours have hijacked the telomerase system to fuel their uninhibited growth.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      The Wistar team has found a new way to map the structure of the most active part of the chemical.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      <b>
    	  
  	
    
      'Few side effects'
    	  
  	
    
      </b>
    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      Dr Emmanuel Skordalakes said that this detailed picture would help provide molecular targets for drugs.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      "Telomerase is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human tumours, but inactive in most normal cells.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      "That means that a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers, with few side effects."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      Professor Rob Newbold, from Brunel University in Uxbridge, said it was a "very important" achievement.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      "Telomerase controls the evolution of cancers - and is a key characteristic of human cancer cells.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      "The idea is that you could convert immortal cancer cells back into mortal ones by blocking telomerase in this way.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      "Having discovered the structure now, it will certainly help the development of drugs."
