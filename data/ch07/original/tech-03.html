      Micro blogging site Twitter is the latest target of cyber criminals who are increasingly finding fertile ground on social networks.
    	  
  	
    
      </b>
    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      A fake Twitter profile with a malicious payload has been spotted by security firm Kaspersky.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      It purports to link to a pornographic video but downloads a fake version of Adobe Flash which installs programs capable of stealing data.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      The attack is believed to be the first to target Twitter.

      <b>
    	  
  	
    
      Social net
    	  
  	
    
      </b>
    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      The attack is believed to have originated in Brazil because of the language it uses, the servers it calls on to download trojans and the e-mail address used to collect stolen data.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      The fake profile has a name that means "pretty rabbit" in Portuguese. It tries to convince users to download the fake Flash video viewer in order to watch the associated video.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      It comes as Kaspersky also releases details about two worms that target social networking sites MySpace and Facebook. More variants of these worms are also starting to turn up.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      The worms transformed victims' machines into zombie computers, used by criminals to send spam, launch phishing attacks and harvest data.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      They were disguised as a link to YouTube which also installed a fake version of Flash Player.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      "Unfortunately users are very trusting of messages left by friends on social networking sites so the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high," said Alexander Gostev, a senior virus analyst at Kaspersky Lab.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      Only those using Microsoft Windows are vulnerable to infection from these malicious programs.
