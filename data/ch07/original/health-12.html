      Even low levels of weekly exercise could help reduce blood pressure and improve fitness, scientists say.

      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Experts say walking for half an hour, five days a week, is the minimum required to achieve health benefits.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
But a Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health report from Northern Ireland found walking on just three days a week gave similar benefits.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The finding could encourage those with sedentary lifestyles to take up exercise gradually, the authors say.

    	  
  	
  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    <div class="bo">

This could be helpful as few people currently meet the minimum recommendations for exercise, with many saying they do not have enough time.

      Blood pressure drops

      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The study, led by researchers at Queen's University, Belfast, looked at 106 healthy but sedentary civil servants aged between 40 and 61.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The participants took part in a 12-week exercise programme - some were assigned to do 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week, others did it three days a week, and the rest did not change their lifestyles.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
In all, 93 people completed the study and their blood pressure, weight and hip circumferences, and other indicators of fitness were all measured before and after the 12-week programme.

There were no changes in the non-walking group, but in both walking groups there was a significant drop in blood pressure and waist and hip measurements.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
This could reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
All walkers also had improved overall fitness.

      Five days minimum
    	  
  	
    
      </b>
    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The authors said such changes were enough to make a difference to an individual's risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
And they concluded: "The results may encourage people who feel they do not have time to exercise on five days each week to consider finding time to commit to a lower weekly target of exercise."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Dr Mark Tully, lead author of the research at Queen's University said exercising five days a week should still be the minimum goal, as it had greater positive effects on blood pressure.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
But he said: "To get to that goal the first hurdle could be to exercise three days a week - it's a more achievable target to build up from.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"And people would still be getting benefits."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
But he said more research was needed to assess the long-term effects of these levels of exercise.

Ellen Mason, a cardiac nurse for the British Heart Foundation, said the study was a reminder that blood pressure could be reduced even through simple activities, such as brisk walking.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
She said: "As this study suggests, the best results can be achieved through exercising for 30 minutes a day, five times a week. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"However, benefits can also be had from exercising three times a week.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"Doing any physical activity is better than doing none." 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
And Ken Fox, professor of health and exercise sciences at the University of Bristol, said it was "good news" that exercising three days a week had health benefits, but that exercising five days would still be better.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
He said: "The message is to exercise five times a week, so you're doing something most days.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"It would be a mistake to change the recommendations from one study."
